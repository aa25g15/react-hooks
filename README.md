# React Hooks

## useState Hook
* React manages application state and re-renders components based on state changes
* useState hook allows us to hook into this state that is managed by React and re-render the UI on state mutations
* If you just delcare a variable and try to change its value directly, it will change the value (regular JS) but it will not re-render the UI and reflect the changes
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const StateTutorial = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("Pedro");

  let onChange = (event) => {
    const newValue = event.target.value;
    setInputValue(newValue);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input placeholder="enter something..." onChange={onChange} />
      {inputValue}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StateTutorial;
```

## useReducer Hook
* The useState and useReducer hook have the same purpose, they both allow us to manage state and update the UI with state changes
* But useReducer is more useful for complex state, when multiple variables/state slices are changing, it is easier to make such large state changes using useReducer hook
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1, showText: state.showText };
    case "toggleShowText":
      return { count: state.count, showText: !state.showText };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const ReducerTutorial = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0, showText: true });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{state.count}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
          dispatch({ type: "toggleShowText" });
        }}
      >
        Click Here
      </button>

      {state.showText && <p>This is a text</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReducerTutorial;
```
